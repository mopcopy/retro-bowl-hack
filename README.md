## About
A hack that allows you to get a large amount of coaching credits (WEB VERSIONS ONLY).

## Running it
To run this hack, open developer console (F12) and run the code in main.js if you are on the main version, college.js for if you are on retro bowl college. If not, you can type `javascript:` in the url bar and paste the code there and hiy enter.

This is currently working across all Retro Bowl versions (tested on poki as well) EXCEPT for mobile. 

This simple hack can also be expanded to give you draft picks, max facilities, and basically anything that is saved by Retro Bowl.

NOTE: May not work for some websites. See alternative method for doing this on poki.

## Alternative (in case it doesn't work, still needs console, PLEASE CAREFULLY READ)

To do this alternative method, open devtools first.

Next, open the application tab, and then check the left menu sidebar. There will likely be a section called "Local Storage" or something of the like. Open all the subpages you see until you see something like this on the main screen: `RetroBowl.0.savedata.ini` 

Next, double-click on the "Value" side of the table currently in blue in the image to edit it, and then find the `coach_credit=""` and edit the number in the quotes (ONLY THE NUMBER INSIDE THE QUOTES) to change the number of credits you have (you can also mess with the other properties inside the file but don't go too far). 

Once you're happy, hit enter, close devtools, and refresh the page. Have fun!
